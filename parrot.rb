# Create method `parrot` that outputs a given phrase and
# returns the phrase

  def parrot(phrase = "Squawk!")
    puts phrase
    phrase
  end
 
 #def parrot(phrase = "Squawk!")
 #   puts phrase
  #  return phrase <-- dont need to write return because it's the last line so because puts is nil and there is phrase on bottom it will automatically return last line which is the argument phrase.
  #end
  #parrot("Pretty bird!") <-- dont need this line because its already written in test spec
